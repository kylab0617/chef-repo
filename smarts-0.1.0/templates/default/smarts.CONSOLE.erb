#			    SAM CONSOLE SUITE
#                             RESPONSE FILE
#
# INTRODUCTION
#
#      This file contains the configurable parameters available for 
# running the installation of  Service Assurance Management CONSOLE silently.
# A Silent Installation allows you to install the suite, or a subset
# of products in the suite, without any human intervention.  The response
# file mimics the way one would select options in the installation UI. 
#
#      "Response" files, also called "options" files, are used 
# to pass command line options to a command as you would normally 
# specify them on the command line itself. The options specified 
# in the response/options file are executed after the execution 
# of the options that were entered directly on the command line.
#
#       Normally, a better installation experience results when
# installing the products with the GUI Wizard.  However, your 
# organization may have policies, either security-based or other,
# which disallows the transmission of the X protocol.  The silent 
# installation allows installation of Service Assurance Management CONSOLE
# while respecting those constraints.
#
# METHOD OF INVOCATION FOR INSTALLATION
#
#       Silent installation may be invoked from only the command-line 
# environment.  The path to the response file must be FULLY QUALIFIED.
#
#       setup-<os>.[bin|exe] -options <path_to_response_file>/<response_file>
# e.g.  setup-solaris.bin -options /home/SAM_CONSOLE_SUITE-response.txt
#
# METHOD OF INVOCATION FOR SILENT UNINSTALLATION
#
#       To silently uninstall all installed components, invoke 
# the uninstaller the following way:
#
# ../_uninst/uninstaller.bin -silent
