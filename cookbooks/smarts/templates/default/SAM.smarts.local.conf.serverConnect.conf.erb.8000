# The first line indicates that field number 3, the password, should be
# encrypted.  It must be the first line in the file.  The lead character, '#',
# is an essential part of the directive.  Once the file is encrypted, a
# second line starting with "#<encryption check> DO NOT ALTER <E-1.0>" is
# inserted into the file.  It provides data for an integrity check.  Do not
# delete or alter this line.
#
#
# serverConnect.conf
#
# Server incoming authorization file.
# This file defines who may connect to a server and with what privileges.
#
# format:
#    target : InCharge user name : password : privileges
#
# The target, InCharge user name and password can be wildcard patterns.
#
# A server will only use a line if its name matches the 'target' field on that
# line.  This allows multiple servers to share a serverConnect file even though
# they accept different credentials (InCharge user name/password pairs).
#
# The 'InCharge user name' and 'password' are sent as authentication data by
# the client.  The 'privileges' field defines the privileges granted by the
# server to this user.
#
# Remember that during the authentication
# process the server receives a connection target, InCharge user name,
# and password from a client. The server checks each of its records
# looking for a match. When it finds the first match, it sends the
# appropriate privilege back to the client. Otherwise the server logs the
# failed authentication. 
# 
# Privileges are: All, Monitor, Ping, None.
#
# Use '\' as an escape character.
#
# Comment lines start with # or //.  Leading and trailing spaces are ignored
# in each field.
#
# Some fields may also contain special values: 
#   Field 'target' may contain <BROKER> or ~<BROKER>.  The value <BROKER>
#   specifies the Broker;  ~<BROKER> specifies all servers, but not the
#   Broker.
#
#   Field 'password' may contain <SYS>.  In this case, the 'InCharge user
#   name' sent by the client must actually be a valid login name on the host
#   operating system.  InCharge will pass the name and password sent by the
#   client to the host operating system for validation.  In this case, the
#   password itself never appears in the authentication file.
#    	
#   Field 'InCharge user name' may contain <DEFAULT>.  This value is used for
#   legacy clients which do not send a user name.
#
#   Field 'password' may contain <DEFAULT>.  This value is used for legacy
#   clients which do not send a password.
#
# Example:
#   <BROKER>    :<DEFAULT>:<DEFAULT>:All
#   InCharge    :admin    :<SYS>    :All
#   InCharge-WP :user5    :ChangeMe :Ping
#   InCharge    :operator :doit     :Monitor
#   InCharge    :*        :<SYS>    :None

##################### Program Access #####################

# The following lines allow servers and clients to connect to a broker.
#
# By default, Brokers are operated in non-secure mode, using the well-known
# credentials BrokerNonsecure/Nonsecure.  To support old programs that do not
# send any authorization credentials they similarly accept <DEFAULT>/<DEFAULT>.
#
# To configure a secure broker:
# 1.  Change the privileges for BrokerNonsecure/Nonsecure to Ping.
# 2.  Comment out the line for <DEFAULT>/<DEFAULT>.
# 3.  Add a line for a username/password of your choosing here and in a
#     corresponding line in clientConnect.conf.
#
<BROKER>:<DEFAULT>:<DEFAULT>:All
# There is a line corresponding to the next one in clientConnect.conf.
