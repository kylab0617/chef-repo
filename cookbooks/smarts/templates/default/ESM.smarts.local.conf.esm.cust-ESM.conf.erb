# Instances of AM Server
# ----------------------
#

# Add one instance of InChargeDomainManager for each InCharge Availability
# Manager that the EMC Server Manager needs to attach to. Type is always "AM".
# DomainName is the name of the AM server as it is registered with the
# broker. DisplayName is arbitrary.
# Note: Object name suffix MUST be same as DomainName, see the following
# example

#InChargeDomain::InChargeDomain_INCHARGE-AM-PM{
#       Type = "AM"
#       DomainName = "INCHARGE-AM-PM"
#       DisplayName = "INCHARGE-AM-PM"
#}

InChargeDomain::InChargeDomain_<%=node['smarts']['gereral']['customerId']%>-AMPM{
       Type = "AM"
       DomainName = "<%=node['smarts']['gereral']['customerId']%>-AMPM"
       DisplayName = "<%=node['smarts']['gereral']['customerId']%>-AMPM"
}
