# The first line indicates that field number 4, the password, should be
# encrypted.  It must be the first line in the file.  The lead character, '#',
# is an essential part of the directive.  Once the file is encrypted, a
# second line starting with "#<encryption check> DO NOT ALTER <E-1.0>" is
# inserted into the file.  It provides data for an integrity check.  Do not
# delete or alter this line.

# clientConnect.conf
#
# Client outgoing authorization file
# This file defines the authentication credentials that clients will send
# to servers.  Brokers do not use this file; see brokerConnect.conf.
#
# format:
#    login user : target : InCharge user name : password
#
# The fields 'login user' and 'target' may be wildcard patterns. 
#
# NOTE: wildcard characters, even when escaped with a single back-slash "\",
# are considered part of a wildcard pattern. This means, for example, a
# password of "change[me", or "change\[me" are both invalid because they
# are not proper wildcard patterns. However, "changem[ey]" and
# "changem\[ey\]" are valid, and authenticate correctly against both
# "changeme" and "changemy". If you want to escape wildcard characters in
# a field, you must escape the "\" using double back-slash "\\". All other
# printable ASCII characters can be used as-is or singly escaped with "\".
# For example, you can use a colon ":" in a password field by escaping it
# like so "change\:me" which authenticates against "change:me". Characters
# that need to be double-escaped are ?, *, [, ], ^, <, >, |, (, ).
#
# When a client other than a console wishes to connect to a server, it reads
# the lines in this file in the order written, searching for a line whose
# 'login user' matches the user running the client and whose 'target' matches
# the name of the server being connected to.  Only the first matching line is
# used (but see the discussion of <PROMPT> below.)
#
# Once a line is located, its 'InCharge user name' and 'password' are sent
# to the target as credentials.
#
# Use '\' as an escape character.
#
# Comment lines start with # or //.  Leading and trailing spaces are ignored
# in each field.
#
# Some fields may also contain special values: 
#   Field 'target' may contain <BROKER> or ~<BROKER>.  The value <BROKER>
#   specifies the Broker;  ~<BROKER> specifies all servers, but not the
#   Broker.
#
#   Field 'InCharge user name' may contain <USERNAME>.  The user name under
#   which the current process is logged in is sent as the 'InCharge user name'.
#
#   Fields 'InCharge user name' and 'password' may contain <PROMPT>.  If the
#   program is attached to a terminal, the system will prompt the user for
#   the corresponding value.  Lines containing a <PROMPT> are skipped by
#   programs that are not attached to a terminal, even if they would otherwise
#   be selected.  (A later line matching the 'login user' and 'target' will be
#   used.)
#
#   Fields 'InCharge user name' and 'password' may contain <DEFAULT>.
#   <DEFAULT> is used by the target to authenticate legacy clients.
#
# Example:
#   *       :<BROKER> : <DEFAULT>  : <DEFAULT>
#   admin   :InCharge : <USERNAME> : <PROMPT>
#   goodop  :~<BROKER>: operator   : doit
#   *       :~<BROKER>: <PROMPT>   : <PROMPT>
 

##################### Program and User Access to Broker #####################

# By default, Brokers are operated in Nonsecure mode, using the well-known
# credentials BrokerNonsecure/Nonsecure.  There is a line corresponding to
# this one in serverConnect.conf.  This section must come before the "User
# Access" section to avoid prompting interactive users for the Broker password.
# If you use a secure Broker and wish to prompt interactive users, combine
# this section with the Program Access section below.

##################### User Access #####################

# All interactive users get prompted.  Note that because it comes first, and
# specifies the match-all '*' for both 'login user' and 'target', this line
# will always be selected for all interactive users, even if they would
# otherwise match a later line.
#*:*:<PROMPT>:<PROMPT>


##################### Program Access #####################

# NOTE: admin has full access.  You should change the password!  When you've
# done so, change the corresponding line in serverConnect.conf.  This section
# must come after the "User Access" section or it will be used for all
# connection attempts, including interactive ones.
